#Aryeo

## Introduction The Aryeo API gives access to the Aryeo platform. You can use your favorite HTTP/REST library for interfacing with the Aryeo API, or you can use one of our SDKs. Our SDKs are procedurally generated and a great starting point for experimental testing. If there is an additional language or framework that you want to see supported, then please reach and out and make a contribution!  <p align=\"center\"> <a href=\"https://github.com/AryeoHQ/aryeo-api-dart-sdk\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AryeoHQ/aryeo-api-docs/master/public/images/dart.svg\" alt=\"Dart\" width=\"44\" style=\"padding:10px;border: 1px solid #d3d3d3;border-radius: 5px;margin:4px;\"/></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/AryeoHQ/aryeo-api-go-sdk\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AryeoHQ/aryeo-api-docs/master/public/images/go.svg\" alt=\"Go\" width=\"44\" style=\"padding:10px;border: 1px solid #d3d3d3;border-radius: 5px;margin:4px;\"/></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/AryeoHQ/aryeo-api-js-sdk\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AryeoHQ/aryeo-api-docs/master/public/images/js.svg\" alt=\"Node JS\" width=\"44\" style=\"padding:10px;border: 1px solid #d3d3d3;border-radius: 5px;margin:4px;\"/></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/AryeoHQ/aryeo-api-php-sdk\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AryeoHQ/aryeo-api-docs/master/public/images/php.svg\" alt=\"PHP\" width=\"44\" style=\"padding:10px;border: 1px solid #d3d3d3;border-radius: 5px;margin:4px;\"/></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/AryeoHQ/aryeo-api-ruby-sdk\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AryeoHQ/aryeo-api-docs/master/public/images/ruby.svg\" alt=\"Ruby\" width=\"44\" style=\"padding:10px;border: 1px solid #d3d3d3;border-radius: 5px;margin:4px;\"/></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/AryeoHQ/aryeo-api-rust-sdk\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AryeoHQ/aryeo-api-docs/master/public/images/rust.svg\" alt=\"Rust\" width=\"44\" style=\"padding:10px;border: 1px solid #d3d3d3;border-radius: 5px;margin:4px;\"/></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/AryeoHQ/aryeo-api-swift-sdk\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AryeoHQ/aryeo-api-docs/master/public/images/swift.svg\" alt=\"Swift\" width=\"44\" style=\"padding:10px;border: 1px solid #d3d3d3;border-radius: 5px;margin:4px;\"/></a> </p>  **Note**: Some SDKs may require you to manually add the `Accept` header to all Aryeo API requests. If so, use the value `application/json`.  # Authentication To start using the Aryeo API, you will need to generate an API key from your group's developer settings. You can then authenticate to the Aryeo API by providing your key in the appropriate request header. Requests made without an API key will result in a `401 Unauthorized` error.

# load the gem
require 'aryeo'

# The following  was generated by the `rspec --init` command. Conventionally, all
# specs live under a `spec` directory, which RSpec adds to the `$LOAD_PATH`.
# The generated `.rspec` file contains `--require spec_helper` which will cause
# this file to always be loaded, without a need to explicitly require it in any
# files.
#
# Given that it is always loaded, you are encouraged to keep this file as
# light-weight as possible. Requiring heavyweight dependencies from this file
# will add to the boot time of your test suite on EVERY test run, even for an
# individual file that may not need all of that loaded. Instead, consider making
# a separate helper file that requires the additional dependencies and performs
# the additional setup, and require it from the spec files that actually need
# it.
#
# The `.rspec` file also contains a few flags that are not defaults but that
# users commonly want.
#
# See http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/Configuration
RSpec.configure do |config|
  # rspec-expectations config goes here. You can use an alternate
  # assertion/expectation library such as wrong or the stdlib/minitest
  # assertions if you prefer.
  config.expect_with :rspec do |expectations|
    # This option will default to `true` in RSpec 4. It makes the `description`
    # and `failure_message` of custom matchers include text for helper methods
    # defined using `chain`, e.g.:
    #     be_bigger_than(2).and_smaller_than(4).description
    #     # => "be bigger than 2 and smaller than 4"
    # ...rather than:
    #     # => "be bigger than 2"
    expectations.include_chain_clauses_in_custom_matcher_descriptions = true
  end

  # rspec-mocks config goes here. You can use an alternate test double
  # library (such as bogus or mocha) by changing the `mock_with` option here.
  config.mock_with :rspec do |mocks|
    # Prevents you from mocking or stubbing a method that does not exist on
    # a real object. This is generally recommended, and will default to
    # `true` in RSpec 4.

# with RSpec, but feel free to customize to your heart's content.

  # These two settings work together to allow you to limit a spec run
  # to individual examples or groups you care about by tagging them with
  # `:focus` metadata. When nothing is tagged with `:focus`, all examples
  # get run.
  config.filter_run :focus
  config.run_all_when_everything_filtered = true

  # Allows RSpec to persist some state between runs in order to support

  # you configure your source control system to ignore this file.

  # be too noisy due to issues in dependencies.
  config.warnings = true

  # Many RSpec users commonly either run the entire suite or an individual
  # file, and it's useful to allow more verbose output when running an
  # individual spec file.

  # particularly slow.

  # order dependency and want to debug it, you can fix the order by providing

  # Seed global randomization in this process using the `--seed` CLI option.

  # test failures related to randomization by passing the same `--seed` value
  # as the one that triggered the failure.
